# Pattern Recognition: Teleprompter Crash Analysis

## Question
My teleprompter crashes with 'Predict object has no attribute new_signature'. How have people tried fixing this before and how do I fix it?

## Correct Answer

Multiple users hit this in [#1059](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/issues/1059), [#1116](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/issues/1116), [#386](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/issues/386). 

### Past attempts:
- Removing assertions
- Downgrading versions  
- Switching teleprompters

### Root cause:
You're using outdated DSPy version. 

### Fix:
Upgrade to DSPy v2.6+ where `new_signature` and old assertion implementations were removed entirely.

## Source Evidence with Links

- [Issue #1116](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/issues/1116) resolution: "none of these components (new_signature; old implementation of assertions v1) are in 2.6"
- Error in `dspy/primitives/assertions.py` line 260
- MIPRO-assertion incompatibility confirmed by maintainers

## Key Points

1. **Pattern Recognition**: This is a recurring issue across multiple GitHub issues (#1059, #1116, #386)
2. **Root Cause**: Using outdated DSPy version with legacy assertion implementations
3. **Solution**: Upgrade to DSPy v2.6+ where the problematic components were removed
4. **Evidence**: Issue #1116 specifically confirms the components causing the error are not present in version 2.6
