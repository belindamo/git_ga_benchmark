# Teleprompter Issue

## Problem
Getting an error about 'new_signature' attribute not found.

## Analysis
This looks like a version problem with DSPy. Some users have reported similar issues before.

## What to Try
1. Try updating DSPy to the latest version
2. Check if your code is using the right syntax
3. Maybe try a different teleprompter if the update doesn't work

## Additional Info
The error seems to happen when using certain features together. Updating usually fixes these kinds of compatibility problems.
