# Teleprompter Crash: 'Predict object has no attribute new_signature'

## Analysis

This is a well-documented recurring issue across multiple GitHub issues in the DSPy repository. I found evidence of this same error pattern in issues #1059, #1116, and #386.

## Pattern Recognition

Multiple users have reported identical crashes with the same error message. The pattern shows:
- Error occurs in dspy/primitives/assertions.py line 260
- Affects users trying to use teleprompters with assertions
- Consistently resolved by version upgrades

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause is using an outdated DSPy version that still contains legacy assertion implementations. Specifically, the 'new_signature' attribute and old assertion implementations (v1) were removed in DSPy v2.6+.

## Past Solutions Attempted

From the issue threads, users have tried:
1. Removing assertions from their code
2. Downgrading to earlier DSPy versions
3. Switching to different teleprompters
4. Various workarounds with assertion syntax

## Recommended Fix

**Upgrade to DSPy v2.6 or later.** According to issue #1116, maintainers confirmed that "none of these components (new_signature; old implementation of assertions v1) are in 2.6."

This error will be completely resolved by upgrading since the problematic legacy code has been removed entirely from the codebase.

## Evidence Sources

- Issue #1116: Direct maintainer confirmation about v2.6 changes
- Issue #1059: Multiple user reports of same error
- Issue #386: Additional pattern confirmation
- Error location: dspy/primitives/assertions.py:260
